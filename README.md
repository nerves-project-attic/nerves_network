[![Hex version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/nerves_network.svg "Hex version")](https://hex.pm/packages/nerves_network)

Connect to wired and wireless networks on Nerves platforms.

# General Installation (WiFi and Wired)

In your firmware's `mix.exs`, add `nerves_network` to your deps for your system target:

```elixir
def deps(target) do
  [ system(target),
    {:nerves_network, "~> 0.5"}
  ]
end
```

# Example Applications
[nerves_examples](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_examples/tree/master/hello_network)
has a networking example that can get you started.

[nerves_init_gadget](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_init_gadget) also
can setup networking for wired ethernet connections and usb gadgets such
as beaglebone boards and raspberry pi 0.

# WiFi Networking

## Installation and Setup

You'll first need to set the regulatory domain in your `config.exs` to your ISO
3166-1 alpha-2 country code. In theory this is optional, but you'll get the
world regulatory domain ("00") which is the most restrictive. This may cause
troubles when you try to connect to an access point.

```elixir
config :nerves_network,
  regulatory_domain: "US"
```

The easiest way to get up and running is by statically setting your WiFi (and possibly ethernet) configuration in `config.exs`:

```elixir
key_mgmt = System.get_env("NERVES_NETWORK_KEY_MGMT") || "WPA-PSK"

config :nerves_network, :default,
  wlan0: [
    networks: [
      [
        ssid: System.get_env("NERVES_NETWORK_SSID"),
        psk: System.get_env("NERVES_NETWORK_PSK"),
        key_mgmt: String.to_atom(key_mgmt)
      ]
    ]
  ],
  eth0: [
    ipv4_address_method: :dhcp
  ]
```

If you are using an older version (`< 0.3.0`) of `nerves_runtime` then you'll need to do some additional setup to load the correct kernel module for WiFi. See [this page](OLD_NERVES_RUNTIME.md) for more information.

## WiFi Networking Priority

If you have more than one possible network, and you would like to automatically
connect the highest priority one you can:

```elixir
settings = [
  networks: [
    [ssid: "FirstPriority", psk: "superSecret", key_mgmt: :"WPA-PSK", priority: 100],
    [ssid: "SettleForThisOne", psk: "StillSecret", key_mgmt: :"WPA-PSK", priority: 10],
    [ssid: "ConnectIfThoseOtherOnesArentAvailable", key_mgmt: :NONE, priority: 0,
      ipv4_address_method: :static,
      ipv4_address: "10.0.0.2", ipv4_subnet_mask: "255.255.0.0",
      domain: "mycompany.com", nameservers: ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"],
    ]
  ]
]

# Now you can either use `default` or runtime setup.

## Default
use Mix.Config
config :nerves_network, default: [
  wlan0: settings,
  eth0: []
]

## Runtime
Nerves.Network.setup("wlan0", settings)
```

## WiFi Network host mode
WpaSupplicant supports WiFi host mode (`mode: 2`). This means it will create an 
access point rather than connect to one. example settings for this:

```elixir
settings = [
  networks: [
    # Note the final `d` in `dhcpd`
    # this will start `OneDHCPD` on the interface.
    [ssid: "NervesAP", psk: "supersecret", key_mgmt: :"WPA-PSK", mode: 2,
     ipv4_address_method: :dhcpd] 
  ]
]
Nerves.Network.setup("wlan0", settings)
```

## Scanning

You can scan by running:

```elixir
iex> {:ok, _pid} = Nerves.Network.setup "wlan0"
iex> Nerves.Network.scan "wlan0"
[%{age: 42, beacon_int: 100, bssid: "00:1f:90:db:45:54", capabilities: 1073,
   flags: "[WEP][ESS]", freq: 2462, id: 8,
   ie: "00053153555434010882848b0c1296182403010b07",
   level: -83, noise: 0, qual: 0, ssid: "1SUT4", tsf: 580579066269},
 %{age: 109, beacon_int: 100, bssid: "00:18:39:7a:23:e8", capabilities: 1041,
   flags: "[WEP][ESS]", freq: 2412, id: 5,
   ie: "00076c696e6b737973010882848b962430486c0301",
   level: -86, noise: 0, qual: 0, ssid: "linksys", tsf: 464957892243},
 %{age: 42, beacon_int: 100, bssid: "1c:7e:e5:32:d1:f8", capabilities: 1041,
   flags: "[WPA2-PSK-CCMP][ESS]", freq: 2412, id: 0,
   ie: "000768756e6c657468010882848b960c1218240301",
   level: -43, noise: 0, qual: 0, ssid: "dlink", tsf: 580587711245}]
```

## Runtime WiFi network setup

Setup your network connection by running:

```elixir
Nerves.Network.setup "wlan0", ssid: "my_accesspoint_name", key_mgmt: :"WPA-PSK", psk: "secret"
```

If your WiFi network does not use a secret key, specify the `key_mgmt` to be
`:NONE`. 

If your WiFi network is using `WEP` connect by running:
```elixir
  Nerves.Network.setup("wlan0", ssid: "wepnet", key_mgmt: :NONE, wep_key0: :"WEPSECRET", wep_tx_keyidx: 0)
```

Currently, wireless configuration passes almost unaltered to
[wpa_supplicant.ex](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_wpa_supplicant), so
see that project for more configuration options.

**Note**
`Nerves.Network.setup` stores your interface's configuration information with [`SystemRegistry`](https://github.com/nerves-project/system_registry), which ties the configuration to the calling process. As such, if the process that called `setup` terminates, the network interface will lose its configuration information and be torn down. You can avoid this by calling `setup` in your application's `start` function, or by configuring `nerves_network` using shoehorn as described below.

# Wired Networking

Wired networking setup varies in how IP addresses are expected to be assigned.
The following examples show some common setups:

```elixir
# Configure a network that supplies IP addresses via DHCP
Nerves.Network.setup "eth0", ipv4_address_method: :dhcp

# Statically assign an address
Nerves.Network.setup "eth0", ipv4_address_method: :static,
    ipv4_address: "10.0.0.2", ipv4_subnet_mask: "255.255.0.0",
    domain: "mycompany.com", nameservers: ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]

# Assign a link-local address
Nerves.Network.setup "usb0", ipv4_address_method: :linklocal
```

# Using `nerves_network` with `shoehorn`

Set default network interface settings as described above. Then you can use [`shoehorn`](https://github.com/nerves-project/shoehorn) to start `nerves_network`:

```elixir
config :shoehorn,
  init: [:nerves_network],
  app: :your_app
```

## Limitations

Currently, only IPv4 is supported. The library is incredibly verbose in its
logging to help debug issues on new platforms in prep for a first release. This
will change. The library is mostly interim in its structure. Please consider
submitting PRs and helping make this work reliably across embedded devices.
